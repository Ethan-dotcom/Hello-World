 <img src="pug.jpg"> <p> Hello world! my name is ethan, and I have been attending RCC for 2 years now. 
I am taking this class for my last few credits I need to graduate. I am also in this class, because I 
wanted to see if programmming was something that I would enjoy.

As you can see on my page I have multiple pictures of animals. They are sadly not mine, but i do really love animals
especially cats. I have over 1000 pictures of cats on my computer and I still don't even own one. I do have a dog
however, which is guess is close enough for now at least.
